This proactive approach prevents violations before they occur.</p><h3>Verification Process</h3><div><!--StartFragment-->A core pillar of UIC compliance is ensuring that disposal activities only occur at properly permitted wells. Mistakenly or fraudulently injecting fluid at an unregistered or suspended site can result in immediate regulatory violations, fines, or environmental liabilities. Our application prevents such errors at the point of action through a robust system of real-time well verification.<!--EndFragment--></div><ul><li><strong>Database Integration:</strong> Real-time connection to state and federal permit databases</li><li><strong>GPS Correlation:</strong> Automatic matching of location to permitted well coordinates</li><li><strong>Permit Status:</strong> Instant verification of current permit validity and restrictions</li><li><strong>Volume Limits:</strong> Automatic checking against daily and monthly injection limits</li></ul><h3>Compliance Benefits</h3><div><!--StartFragment-->Manual well identification, relying on paper logs, memory, or loosely labeled infrastructure introduces unacceptable risk. State regulators maintain active well status databases, and operators must prove not only that fluids were injected but that they were injected at the&nbsp;<i>correct</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>permitted</i>&nbsp;site. Automating this verification adds a crucial compliance safeguard and greatly reduces human error.&nbsp;<span>Since implementation, our clients have achieved 100% compliance rates with zero permit violations. The system continues to prevent potential violations through proactive alerts, saving operators millions in potential fines and protecting their operational licenses.</span></div><h3>Advanced Features</h3><p>The verification system includes predictive analytics that forecast permit expiration's and volume limit approaches, allowing operators to plan ahead and maintain continuous compliance.&nbsp;</p><p><b style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Inter, -apple-system, Roboto, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.5vw;\">Real-Time Well Verification:\nPreventing Unauthorized Disposal Before It Happens</b></p><p><span>A core pillar of UIC compliance is\nensuring that disposal activities only occur at properly permitted wells.\nMistakenly or fraudulently injecting fluid at an unregistered or suspended site\ncan result in immediate regulatory violations, fines, or environmental\nliabilities. Our application prevents such errors at the point of action\nthrough a robust system of real-time well verification.<o:p></o:p></span></p><h3><span>The application maintains a synchronized\ndatabase of permitted wells including metadata such as API number, lease name,\noperator, and well status (active, suspended, shut-in). This database is\nperiodically pulled from state or operator APIs and stored locally on the\nmobile device to support offline operation.</span></h3><p><span>Each well is defined as a geofenced\npolygon or precise coordinate location, tagged with its regulatory status. When\na vehicle enters a site boundary, the app immediately attempts to match the\ncurrent GPS coordinates to a known permitted well. This is done via a fast\nspatial index lookup followed by a geofencing algorithm to confirm boundary\ncontainment.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>If no match is found, or if the well is\nflagged as inactive or suspended, the app prevents any UIC workflow from\nproceeding. In most deployments, this blocks the ability to initiate flow meter\ncapture, sign tickets, or generate reports until the issue is resolved.\nAdministrators are notified via backend alerting systems, and the event is\nlogged for audit purposes.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p><span>To avoid false positives near the edge of\noverlapping or adjacent wells, the verification system includes a confidence\nzone buffer and time thresholding logic to ensure that fleeting GPS errors do\nnot trigger a block. The verification step is also tied to driver\nauthentication and site dwell time to ensure temporal alignment with valid\ndisposal operations.</span></p><h3><a></a></h3><p><br></p>",
